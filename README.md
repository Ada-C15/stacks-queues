# Stacks & Queues

In this exercise we will implement both a stack & a queue, and then use them in a variety of hands-on exercises.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this exercise you should be able to:

- Implement a stack & a queue using linked lists and arrays
- Write a Queue using a circular buffer
- Use a stack and a queue to solve common interview problems.

## Wave 1 - Implement a Stack

Using a Linked list (from a previous exercise) implement a Stack with the following methods:

- `push(value)` - Adds the value to the top of the stack
- `pop` - Removes and returns an element from the top of the stack
- `empty?` returns true if the stack is empty and false otherwise

## Wave 2 Implement a Queue

Using a circular buffer with an internal array starting at 20 elements, implement a Queue with the following methods:

- `enqueue(value)` - Adds the value to the back of the queue.
- `dequeue` - removes and returns a value from the front of the queue
- `empty?` returns true if the queue is empty and false otherwise

#### Additional Exercise

If you finish the previous waves, complete [breadth-first-search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bfs-vs-dfs-binary-tree/) on the binary trees project using a Queue.
